892,1,their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place

904,0,and the drinks are weak people
905,0,name
906,0,also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house

913,0,i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that
914,0,how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand
915,0,im not impressed with the concept or the food
916,0,the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it
917,0,there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better
918,0,i got food poisoning here at the buffet
919,0,they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no

930,0,disappointing experience
931,0,the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all

933,0,waayy over rated is all i am saying
934,0,we wont be going back
935,0,the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it
936,0,this place lacked style
937,0,the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was ridiculous
938,0,dont bother coming here
939,0,the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork
940,0,the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again
941,0,it was equally awful
942,0,probably not in a hurry to go back
943,0,very slow at seating even with reservation
944,0,not good by any stretch of the imagination
945,0,the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked
946,0,the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat
947,0,it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor
948,0,i was very disappointed
949,0,this place is horrible and way overpriced
950,0,maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best
951,0,it wasnt busy at all and now we know why
952,0,the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu
953,0,the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits
954,0,con spotty service
955,0,the fries were not hot and neither was my burger
956,0,but then they came back cold
957,0,then our food came out disappointment ensued
958,0,the real disappointment was our waiter
959,0,my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything
960,0,the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach
961,0,insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it
962,0,if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart
963,0,she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door
964,0,after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat here what a disappointment
965,0,del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible
966,0,its not hard to make a decent hamburger
967,0,but i dont like it
968,0,hell no will i go back
969,0,weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant
970,0,i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall
971,0,i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar
972,0,the ambiance isnt much better
973,0,unfortunately it only set us up for disappointment with our entrees
974,0,the food wasnt good
975,0,your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked
976,0,what happened next was pretty off putting
977,0,too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place
978,0,overpriced for what you are getting
979,0,i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch
980,0,i kept looking at the time and it had soon become minutes yet still no food
981,0,i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list
982,0,we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh
983,0,food was below average
984,0,it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant
985,0,all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop
986,0,the problem i have is that they charge for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables
987,0,shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold
988,0,it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry
989,0,it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down
990,0,i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage
991,0,the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland
992,0,spend your money and time some place else
993,0,a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad
994,0,the presentation of the food was awful
995,0,i cant tell you how disappointed i was
996,0,i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking
997,0,appetite instantly gone
998,0,overall i was not impressed and would not go back
999,0,the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time
1000,0,then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check
