852,0,I probably would not go here again.
853,1,So flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat.
854,1,The price is reasonable and the service is great.
855,0,"The Wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp), and our friends really did not enjoy their meals, either."
856,0,My fella got the huevos rancheros and they didn't look too appealing.

982,0,We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh.
983,0,Food was below average.
984,0,It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.
985,0,"All in all, Ha Long Bay was a bit of a flop."
986,0,The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).
987,0,Shrimp- When I unwrapped it (I live only 1/2 a mile from Brushfire) it was literally ice cold.
